thirdparty
==========

This is a section of the project including various third-party libraries that
are distributed as part of Configurate. While it is preferable to use published
libraries, this allows using projects that are forked in order to patch bugs or
receive new features ahead of upstream, without these changes being visible to
downstream users.

an upstream release.
